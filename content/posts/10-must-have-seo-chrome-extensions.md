In my previous articles about SEO bookmarklets, I said I want to keep Chrome extensions to a minimum, but I still have 10+ extensions that I really don't want to remove. Here are the ones that I use daily, or almost, for work.

## ColorZilla

This colour picker tool is probably the extension I use the most, for any design work, literally. In one click, it gives you the RGB + Hex colour codes of any element on a webpage and it copies the Hex code to your clipboard. It also offers a convenient colour history feature, so that you can easily find back some recently used colours. 

## Grammarly

I write... a lot. And I make mistakes... a lot. Especially since English isn't my mother tongue. I'm not saying Grammarly is a magical solution, but it sure fixes at least 50% of my mistakes (especially when it comes to punctuation and spelling mistakes)! This typing assistant comes in a free and paid version, but I am more than satisfied with the free version.
