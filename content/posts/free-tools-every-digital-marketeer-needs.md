Through the years I have been using a lot of online tools and when switching to Brave browser, I noticed that my bookmarks needed a bit of cleaning up.

So I went through all the tools I had bookmarked and here are the winners (ie the ones I actually use regularly).

## Brave

Not really a tool, but I wanted to include it in the list as I introduced it in the intro. 

I found Chrome to be particularly RAM hungry on Macbook compared to Safari, but I couldn't leave Chrome because of some extensions that I not available on Safari. When I heard about Brave, I decided to give it a try and I stuck with it.

Brave is based on Chromium, so it supports all the Chrome extensions, but Brave is also faster and better in privacy than Chrome. Plus you can receive a crypto called BAT (Brave Attention Tokens) by browsing the web. A nice bonus considering the amount of time I spend online.

## Photopea

I like photography and I used to edit my photos with Photoshop and Lightroom, but since I switched to Luminar AI, I couldn't justify Photoshop for basic edits related to my work (resizing images, editing backgrounds,...). Photopea is the perfect free online Photoshop "clone" and I use it daily. It's impressive how good it compares to Photoshop considering that it's free. 

## Canva

Not sure Canva still needs an introduction. If I had to keep only one tool on the list, that would be the one. I use this drag and drop graphic design tool to create anything from Facebook ads designs to whitepapers. I can't even emphasize enough how much time Canva has saved me since I started using it, especially thanks to all the templates offered... a great starting point to get inspired.

## Tinywow

This isn't actually one tool, but more than 50 tools on a single webpage. The one I use the most is the background remover, which works great with not too complex images (and when it doesn't work, I do it manually with Photopea). But the website also offers an impressive amount of format conversion tools (PDF to Word, WebP to JPG, SVG to PNG,...) and other useful features such as PDF e-signature, PDF compression or a Lorem Ipsum generator.
