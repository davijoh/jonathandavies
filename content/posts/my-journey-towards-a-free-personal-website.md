Since I started working as a digital marketing consultant, I´ve always wanted to have my own website. After all, I build websites for a living but I don´t have my own?!

The problem is I don't feel like spending monthly money on it. I just want to store my notes.

"Why don't you go for Notion or Wordpress.org?"

Two things, I want my own domain and I want it to be SEO friendly (I can't help it, the SEO in me is addicted to green lighthouse scores...).

And to be honest, where's the challenge in that?!

So, back to my journey.

A typical website brings several costs:

* Hosting
* CMS like wordpress.com
* Domain name rental

So what can I do to pay as little as possible?

After some research, I've come to the conclusion that my best option - and the most challenging one - is a **static website**.
