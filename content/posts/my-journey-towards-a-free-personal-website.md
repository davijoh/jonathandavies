Since I started working as a digital marketing consultant, I´ve always wanted to have my own website. After all, I build websites for a living but I don´t have my own?!

The problem is I don't feel like spending monthly money on it. I just want to store my notes.

"Why don't you go for Notion or Wordpress.org?"

Two things, I want my own domain and I want it to be SEO friendly (I can't help it, the SEO in me is addicted to green lighthouse scores...).

And to be honest, where's the challenge in that?!

So, back to my journey.

A typical website brings several costs:

* Hosting
* CMS like wordpress.com
* Domain name rental

So what can I do to pay as little as possible?

After some research, I've come to the conclusion that my best option - and the most challenging one - is a **static website**.

Static websites are fast, secure and in most cases... free! 

Except for the domain name. There is nothing we can do there.

Actually, this isn't true...

I purchased jonathandavies.nft on Unstoppable Domains for $20. This is basically an NFT domain provider. Meaning you pay only once to acquire the domain name and that's it, no yearly renewal to pay. 

How come?

You actually own your NFT domain and you don't rent it, contrary to regular domain names. 

The catch?

Well, most browsers don't support NFT domains yet... 

I know, kind of a turn off. I'm hoping this changes fast.

**But my point is, my static website + hosting + CMS + domain name cost me a one-time fee of $20.**
