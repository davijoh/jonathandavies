Since working as a digital marketing consultant, I´ve always wanted to have my own website. After all, I build websites for a living but I don´t have my own?!

The problem is I don't feel like spending money on it, I just want to store my notes. I want what they call a Digital Garden.

I also don't want anything to do with Squarespace or Wix. They are great for most people, but my SEO addict side says no.
