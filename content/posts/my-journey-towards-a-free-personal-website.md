Since I started working as a digital marketing consultant, I´ve always wanted to have my own website. After all, I build websites for a living but I don´t have my own?!

The problem is I don't feel like spending money on it monthly. I just want to store my notes.

"Why don't you go for Notion or Wordpress.org?"

Two things, I want my own domain and I want it to be SEO friendly (I can't help it, the SEO in me is addicted to green lighthouse scores...).

And to be honest, where's the challenge in that?!

## My journey

A typical website brings several costs:

* Hosting
* CMS like wordpress.com
* Domain name rental

So what can I do to pay as little as possible?

After some research, I've come to the conclusion that my best option - and the most challenging one - is a **static website**.

Static websites are fast, secure and in most cases... free! 

Except for the domain name. There is nothing we can do there.

Actually, this isn't true...

I purchased jonathandavies.nft on Unstoppable Domains for $20. This is basically an NFT domain provider. Meaning you pay only once to acquire the domain name and that's it, no yearly renewal to pay. 

How come?

You actually own your NFT domain and you don't rent it, contrary to regular domain names. 

The catch?

Well, most browsers don't support NFT domains yet... (Brave, that I use, does, but most people don't use it).

I know, kind of a turn off. I'm hoping this changes fast.

**But my point is, my static website + hosting + CMS + domain name cost me a one-time fee of $20.**

Here is the breakdown:

* Static website generator: Hugo (free)
* Hosting: Netlify (free for personal website)
* CMS: Forestry (free)
* Domain name: Unstoppable Domain ($20)
* Lighthouse scores: 100 - 100 - 100 

## Why Hugo?

Pickling a static site generator was actually more difficult than I thought.

I don't want to go too much into the details here, as I am no expert, but my first pick wasn't Hugo.

After reading several articles, I decided to go for 11ty. It's one of the newest players and it has a smaller community, but several articles recommended it as it's growing in popularity and supposedly easier to use.

The thing is, I know nothing about static websites and my coding level is barely enough to write some custom CSS and HTML on Wordpress websites... 

This means I can't code a static website from scratch and I need a theme to play with. That was the first limitation of 11ty... I couldn't find a theme that ticked my boxes...

The second limitation came up when creating the website. A smaller community means fewer tutos available and fewer problems resolved online.

After hours of trials and errors, I couldn't get a working website. Git errors, Netlify fails,... 

(I know I probably jumped many steps by trying to create a static website without knowing code, but I believe in learning by trying)

I am not saying 11ty is bad. In fact, it's one of the best generators out there. It's just not for complete beginners.

Soooo...

After some more research, I decided to go for Hugo. Its blazing fast reputation comforted my SEO ego and as it's been here for a while, it has a strong community and plenty of themes to pick from.

Other contenders were Jekyll, Gatsby and Next.js. They all have a strong community.

Why Hugo? I repeat: it's fast. Yes, it adds Golang to the coding languages mix, compared to 11ty, but whatever. 

## Hosting and CMS

There are a few options for free hosting, including Netlify, Github Pages and Vercel. 

I went for Netlify.

Github Pages seemed like a less popular option nowadays and Vercel seemed more complicated.

The connexion between my Github repository and Netlify was seamless!

As for the CMS, there were a few free options as well, starting with Netlify's own product.
